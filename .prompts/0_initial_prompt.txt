# prd-draft.md -> plan.md

I want to build a web app for users to edit captions easily for their videos.

I put my initial ideas, project goal, features, requirements, and possible architecture in @docs/prd-draft.md .

YOUR JOB: generate the following materials so that we can develop according to them in the future:
* An action plan
* A list of libraries to use
* Initial project directory structure

Do not jump into conclusion.  Do not implement any codes yet.

Ask me questions for you to gain more information about the project.
Use web search as part of your considering when choosing libraries.

Think carefully.  Write and update your plan to `docs/plan.md` every time you respond.  We plan this together iteratively.
